Choose your own adventure CSE assignment

### description
This project is a game in which the user progresses through a spaceship. Blah
blah blah...

### usage
You can run the game by simply running the `main.py` program. If you want to
hone your skills in a particular room, you can run that room module instead. 

### tests
Unit testing is good! To make sure you haven't killed anyone important, you
can run the tests located in `tests/` by trying this from the project root:

```python
python tests/test_inventory.py -v
```

etc. for other test cases.
