# Solution to Room 6

### problem statement
There is an AI named JEFF. Use an item in your inventory to kill it.

### solution
Just from the hints and the source code, we can tell that there is a specific
item that we need to try to kill JEFF. Unfortunately, we don't know what that
item is. You'll just have to go back through the past few rooms and try all
the items there are. One would think that it would be a USB stick or something
tech-related, but all you actually need is brute force: a `crowbar`! You'll
have to brute-force through all the items so that you can use brute force to
kill JEFF.

So brute force really is the solution, in more ways than one.
